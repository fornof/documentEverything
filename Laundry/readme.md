You know how your apartment looks like a bomb exploded right before company comes over? No? Well, even if it is just me that experiences this, I noticed most of the debris are clothes. 
To handle, there's a [Marie Kondō](https://www.amazon.com/Spark-Joy-Illustrated-Organizing-Changing/dp/1607749726/ref=pd_bxgy_img_2/135-0179507-4021512?_encoding=UTF8&pd_rd_i=1607749726&pd_rd_r=36edd0e0-a5df-453b-869c-2f41fcab3026&pd_rd_w=NBvx7&pd_rd_wg=aioDZ&pf_rd_p=f325d01c-4658-4593-be83-3e12ca663f0e&pf_rd_r=73240SB1HY9ZGE646137&psc=1&refRID=73240SB1HY9ZGE646137) book on the joy of cleaning, but lets focus on laundry for now.

This [New York Times article](nytimes.com/guides/smarterliving/how-to-do-laundry) has some good tips and suggestions on laundry

## Sort like with like 
### Steps
 - Put like colors together : whites, lights, darks, and brights 
### Details
 - do not combine brights or colors that bleed with whites unless you are 100% certain all your colors are color fast and do not bleed. If you know that you know all your colors are color fast, and you want to risk the biscuit/chance of colors bleeding, you have the option to put all your clothes in at the same time - [read this article from Martha Stewart co](https://www.marthastewart.com/267832/the-wash-cycle) for details/possible results. 

## Toss and compress
### Steps
- ask these questions : 
    - Have I worn this in the past 3 months? 
    - Is this something I need to keep due to use? 
    - Will I feel bad if I toss it? 
    
    If no to all of those questions, put it in the donate pile 
### Details
Marie Kondō has a great way to get started with process of cleaning in her [cleaning books](https://www.amazon.com/Spark-Joy-Illustrated-Organizing-Changing/dp/1607749726/ref=pd_bxgy_img_2/135-0179507-4021512?_encoding=UTF8&pd_rd_i=1607749726&pd_rd_r=36edd0e0-a5df-453b-869c-2f41fcab3026&pd_rd_w=NBvx7&pd_rd_wg=aioDZ&pf_rd_p=f325d01c-4658-4593-be83-3e12ca663f0e&pf_rd_r=73240SB1HY9ZGE646137&psc=1&refRID=73240SB1HY9ZGE646137) that are usually also available at the library   The hardest part is to continue steps since they are in book format. My suggestion if you go this route is to make your own steps/outline the essentials of this book and to keep that in a todo list [Such as Microsoft Todo](https://todo.microsoft.com) or on [trello](https://trello.com) for easy reference 


## Wash and Dry
### Steps 
- put loads in the washer set based on average garment tag in load, or follow best practices for your load
- after washer cycle completes, take load out of washer and put into dryer. Follow best practices for drying - permanent press being suggested default. 
- repeat with each load
### Details
Each garment comes with a tag on how to launder. Ideally these are taken into account to get the best settings.  

## Put Away Clothes
### Steps
- hang up shirts, any ironable wear, pants
- fold tshirts, undergarments 
### Details
There are 38 million google entries on how to [hang pants](https://www.google.com/search?rlz=1C1CHBF_enUS878US878&sxsrf=ALeKk00lJMrhTsRdjMQK5ddezuysi3TQNA%3A1606668895579&ei=X9LDX4jvIqaP9PwPiviLsAE&q=how+to+hang+up+dress+pants&oq=how+to+hang+up+dress+pants&gs_lcp=CgZwc3ktYWIQAzIFCAAQyQMyBggAEBYQHjIGCAAQFhAeMgYIABAWEB4yBggAEBYQHjoECAAQRzoECCMQJzoECAAQQzoLCC4QsQMQxwEQowI6DgguELEDEIMBEMcBEKMCOgIIADoFCAAQkQI6BwgAEMkDEEM6BwgAEBQQhwI6CggAEMkDEBQQhwI6CAghEBYQHRAeUIwhWIFEYMFFaAFwAngAgAGKAYgBiQ6SAQQyNS4ymAEAoAEBqgEHZ3dzLXdpesgBCMABAQ&sclient=psy-ab&ved=0ahUKEwjImquGnKjtAhWmB50JHQr8AhYQ4dUDCA0&uact=5)
If details are not referenced here, they can be googled. 

There are many ways to fold. The two that I like are: 
- [Side-Side-Fold-Square](https://youtu.be/AcZ5wS5HCrM?t=91)
- [Fast-Fold](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uz6rjbw0ZA0)
I tend to prefer Side-Side-Fold-Square, because even though the other one is fast, it tends to become unravelled. 

##  Clean Closet 
### Steps
- Clean the closet so that clothes can be quickly accessed and put away without tripping over anything. 
### Details
My closet is sometimes messy. This step keeps things clear.
